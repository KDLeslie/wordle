# Overview

This is a simple web game that takes advantage of cloud storage and a client-server model to hide game secrets outside of the browser. Microsoft Azure is used to host the application, and the game logic is achieved through HTTP requests made from the browser to an HTTP Trigger Azure Function App. The server source can be found [here](https://github.com/KDLeslie/wordle-server) and the app can be accessed [here](https://wordle.azurewebsites.net).
